To complete this exercise, you will need access to the [Cyberwildcats Proxmox](https://cyberwildcats.net/pages/resources.html#Proxmox) [Hypervisor Cluster](https://10.1.11.33:8006).  Please note that [Cyberwildcats VPN](https://cyberwildcats.net/pages/resources.html#VPN) access is also required.  The [Cyberwildcats Proxmox Usage Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10za4H5M7x0PT7BJGLX9eKB7RoPmtZBwR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116857645506738452141&rtpof=true&sd=true) will also be very helpful to you.

To complete this exercise, you must have also completed these other exercises first:

1. [Install a Windows Desktop](activities/windows/install_windows_desktop.md)
2. [Install a Windows Server](activities/windows/install_windows_server.md)


Login to the Proxmox cluster and login to the Windows server you created in the second exercise listed above.  If you have not already, install Active Directory and configure it for a custom domain of your choosing.  After the domain is successfully completed, login to the Windows Desktop you created in the first exercise above and join it to the domain.
